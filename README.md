# Fallout RPG is a homebrew system created by Gustavo dos Reis. This is a support software for the creation and management of character sheets.

## Stack
- HTML, CSS and Alpine.js for frontend
- AWS Lambda Functions and DynamoDB for backend
- Hosting on Github Pages and AWS serveless (is this hosting? :D)

This is a very much side project, but made with love S2
